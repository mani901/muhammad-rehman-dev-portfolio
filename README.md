# Muhammad Rehman's MERN Portfolio

_(React + Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion)_

Hey there! This is my clean, speedy portfolio template built for final-year software engineering students and MERN stack developers. It's recruiter-friendly, has readable code, and is easy to customize.

### What's Inside?

- Fully responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Smooth animations powered by Framer Motion (with accessibility in mind)
- A cool typewriter intro (works even with motion reductions)
- Reusable React components for sections like skills, projects, and experience
- Mobile-friendly menu that actually works (and closes when you click links)

### Sections You'll Find

- **Navbar:** Smooth scrolling and mobile-friendly dropdown
- **Hero Area:** Catchy intro with quick action buttons
- **Technical Skills:** Organized by backend, frontend, databases, and tools
- **Projects:** Cards with links to live demos and code repositories
- **Experience:** Highlights from my final-year projects and open-source contributions
- **Contact:** Easy ways to reach me (email, phone, GitHub, LinkedIn)

### Tech Stack
